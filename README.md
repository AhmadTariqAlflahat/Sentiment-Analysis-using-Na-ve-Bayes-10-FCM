##Assignment 2 
##Sentiment Analysis

###The goal for this homework is to perform Sentiment Analysis by classifying entire movie reviews as being either positive or negative.  
 
###Train a Naïve Bayes classifier on the Internet Movie Database review (imdb1) data set provided to you with Laplace (add-1) smoothing. Your classifier will use words as features (unigram). Use log probability scores. 
 
 
####Task 1: Your first task is to use Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier to train and test using 10 fold crossvalidation mechanism. Evaluate your classifier by reporting the confusion matrix and average accuracy.  
 
####Task2: Remove stop words from your train and test sets. You have been provided with file (english.stop) that includes the stop-words you need to remove. Evaluate your model again with the stop words removed. Does this approach affect average accuracy?  
 
####Task3: Repeat task one reporting the results of using Boolean Naive Bayes classifier. This means removing duplicate words in each document (review) before training. Does this approach affect average accuracy?  
 
####Task4: Repeat task 1 using a bigram and trigrams features. Report results and discuss. 
 
Submit on the eLearning a zip file of your assignment. It should include the source code and a separate file (word document) that includes a printout of the results from your four tasks, along with a short discussion on the results.
